Add doctor availability features and improve appointment slot management

Backend changes:

  * First doctor must have both morning and afternoon availability
  * Prevent disabling availability if it would leave no doctors for a session
  * Validation in both create and update operations
- Add repository methods for doctor availability queries
- Auto-assign doctors to appointment slots based on morning/afternoon availability
  * Morning slots (before 12:00) assigned to doctors with morning=true
  * Afternoon slots (12:00+) assigned to doctors with afternoon=true
  * Round-robin distribution among available doctors
- Sort appointment slots by start time (chronological order)
